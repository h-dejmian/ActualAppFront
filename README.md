# ActualApp (frontend)
Web application to control daily activities and organize time

# DescriptionInput
Web application that can be used to track how many time we spend on different activities during the day.  
Users are able to create activities, delete, and update them when needed. To view activities by a specific date we can use interactive calendar.
We can also form categories that we assign to activities. Categories can be managed just like activities.

Simple day planner is available as well. We can provide activities with time range that will be completed in the future.  
'Noted' functionality is for gathering single categorized activities that we want to keep in mind like books we would like to read or movies that we would like to watch.  

In the Statistics part of the web site we can display actual statistic data about all the activities. We can view for example number of activities grouped by categories, or time that we spend on specific category or activity.
